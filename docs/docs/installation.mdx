:::caution
A new version of covfee is coming. At the moment, this version is only installable using the [development install instructions](development).

I'll update these instructions when the new version is ready to be installed from PyPI.
:::

<!--
Covfee is a Python package installable using pip. You will then be able to launch covfee in a browser window from the command line (much like launching Jupyter notebooks). 

:::caution
Covfee runs on **Linux, Mac OS X and Windows**, but you are more likely to encounter bugs on Windows. We recommend that you use [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) on Windows.

### Prerequisites

The only prerequisites for installing Covfee locally are Python 3 and Node.js:

- [Python 3 (>= 3.6)](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). Make sure that the `npm` command is available in your terminal.

### Setup

We recommend that you work with Covfee locally in your computer first, even if you plan to [deploy it to a server](deployment). To install Covfee locally:

1. Create and activate a virtual environment for Covfee, using eg. virtualenv or conda. You may install Covfee globally (without this step) but we recommend a virtual environment to avoid possible dependency conflicts.

2. Install covfee via:

```
python -m pip install covfee
```

For a development setup, recommended if you want to program your own covfee tasks, please see [Development Install](development)

OpenVIMO is a platform for videocalling built as a covfee task. It's main application is recording of online social interaction such as pair conversations or online meetings. Among its features are:

- Different study designs can be specified in Python using a graph structure.
- Crowdsourcing support through covfee.
- Videocalls can be timed.
- Chat with data subjects.
- Admin can view the videocalls without interferring. Please use responsibly by informing data subjects if you intend to use this feature.
- Admin can pause, restart or force stop the videocalls.

## Installation

Here we provide instructions for testing OpenVIMO in [development mode](../development). To know how to move an OpenVIMO app to production, see [below](#moving-to-production).

First install covfee following the [development install instructions](../development.mdx).

Open**VIMO** is built on top of Open**VIDU**, an open-source WebRTC framework with an on-premise server that integrates an API for handling calls, a STUN/TURN server and recording capabilities. The OpenVIDU server should be ran separately. To do it, follow [OpenVIDU deployment instructions](https://docs.openvidu.io/en/stable/deployment/ce/on-premises/).

### Sample 1: meeting room

Here we create a simple covfee app for meeting rooms with shareable URLs. This can function as a flexible deployment for holding (regular) meetings in covfee and recording them into a dataset.

In covfee experiments (HITs) are always specified by a list of nodes or tasks, and a list of journeys or paths through those nodes. Each of these journeys maps to a URL, and normally to one participant. However, because in this case we want to allow an arbitrary number of participants to join the videocall using the same URL, we will create a single journey. The graph structure of this deployment is therefore very simple:

<div class="text--center">
  <img src={useBaseUrl("/img/g_meeting.png")} width="250" />
</div>

First we will create a folder for the covfee project. This folder may be anywhere in the file system. Then we will create the following structure:

```
my_folder
    - meeting.py
```

The naming is not relevant. Paste the following into the `meeting.py`:

```python
from covfee import HIT, Project, tasks
from covfee.config import config
from covfee.shared.dataclass import CovfeeApp

config.load_environment("local")

spec_meeting = {
    "name": "Videocall",
    "serverRecording": {
        "hasAudio": True,
        "hasVideo": True,
        "outputMode": "INDIVIDUAL",
    },
}

t1 = tasks.VideocallTaskSpec(**spec_meeting)
hit = HIT("Videocalling")
hit.add_journey(nodes=[t1])

projects = [Project("My Project", email="example@example.com", hits=[hit])]
app = CovfeeApp(projects)
```

Here we import the necessary classes, create a VideocallTaskSpecs object holding the specification of our videocalling task, and assign it to a journey, a HIT and a project ([more information](../entities)). Finally, we create the `app` object. Covfee internally looks for this object by name (important that it is called `app`) and uses it as starting point to read the specification.

- The full list of options for the VideocallTaskSpec is provided [below](#configuration-options).

That is all! We are now ready to start Covfee. To run it in development mode:

```
covfee make meeting.py --force --dev
```

This will parse the specification, create the database, and start the covfee server.

And make sure to start webpack on another tab ([more info](../development)):

```
covfee webpack
```

After this the Covfee admin panel should be accessible in the URL displayed when running the Covfee server (http://localhost:5000/admin# by default).

For more information about running Covfee in development mode [see here](../development).

### Sample 2: dyadic conversations

This sample creates a more complex HIT structure. Here we want two subjects to fill in individual consent forms, then have a videocall together, and then fill in post-experiment surveys. The graph structure for this interaction is:

<div class="text--center">
  <img src={useBaseUrl("/img/g_dyadic.png")} width="600" />
</div>

We can code this structure with the following code:

```python
# from covfee import Task, HIT
from covfee import HIT, Project, tasks
from covfee.config import config
from covfee.shared.dataclass import CovfeeApp

config.load_environment("local")

spec_consent_form = {
    "name": "Consent",
    "content": {"type": "link", "url": "$$www$$/consent.md"},
    "form": {
        "fields": [
            {
                "name": "name",
                "label": "Full name:",
                "required": True,
                "input": {"inputType": "Input"},
            },
            {
                "name": "consent",
                "label": "To proceed, you must expressly provide consent per the terms above.",
                "required": True,
                "input": {
                    "inputType": "Checkbox.Group",
                    "options": [
                        {
                            "label": "I consent to the sharing of my personal data.",
                            "value": "yes",
                        }
                    ],
                },
            },
        ]
    },
}

spec_instructions = {
    "name": "Instructions",
    "prerequisite": True,
    "content": {"type": "link", "url": "$$www$$/instructions.md"},
    "form": {
        "fields": [
            {
                "name": "agreement",
                "label": "To proceed, you must expressly agree to the provided instructions.",
                "required": True,
                "input": {
                    "inputType": "Checkbox.Group",
                    "options": [
                        {
                            "label": "I agree with the provided instructions.",
                            "value": "yes",
                        }
                    ],
                },
            }
        ]
    },
}

spec_videocall = {
    "name": "Videocall",
}

spec_final_survey = {
    "name": "Final Survey",

        "fields": [
            {

                },
            }
        ]
    },
}
j1_consent = tasks.InstructionsTaskSpec(**spec_consent_form)
j1_instructions = tasks.InstructionsTaskSpec(**spec_instructions)
j1_final = tasks.QuestionnaireTaskSpec(**spec_final_survey)

j2_consent = tasks.InstructionsTaskSpec(**spec_consent_form)
j2_instructions = tasks.InstructionsTaskSpec(**spec_instructions)
j2_final = tasks.QuestionnaireTaskSpec(**spec_final_survey)

videocall_task = tasks.VideocallTaskSpec(**spec_videocall)


hit = HIT("Dyadic videocall")
j1 = hit.add_journey(nodes=[j1_consent, j1_instructions, videocall_task, j1_final])
j1 = hit.add_journey(nodes=[j2_consent, j2_instructions, videocall_task, j2_final])

projects = [Project("My Project", email="example@example.com", hits=[hit])]
app = CovfeeApp(projects)

```

## Moving to production

1. Make sure that OpenVIDU is installed in your server in production mode. Recording requires a server with significant [resources and open ports](https://docs.openvidu.io/en/stable/deployment/ce/on-premises/).

2. Move your covfee app to production by following Covfee's [deployment instructions](../deployment).
